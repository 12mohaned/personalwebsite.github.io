Disclaimer :- 

This is a very Simple Website follow very simple concepts not used for production or learning a-lot of things could have be done better to make the code more clean and efficient 

i.e : 1) template inheritance, using a parent file for all common files for  example called base.html contain common code     among all files instead of re-writing code 
      2) use a seperate css file and linking it in the html file 
      3) a more interactive UI 
      4) using a framework 

and the list goes on ...
